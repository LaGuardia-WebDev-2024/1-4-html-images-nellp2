        <h1>The Perfect Trip</h1>
        
        <p>If I were to take the perfect trip, it would likely take place in a world-renowned city. 
          I would see scenes of glittering skylines, flashing lights, and the noises of the crowds of people 
          and cars.</p>
        
        <p>I would see animals such as cats, dogs, and rabbits.
        
        <p>And eat food from numerous cultures and backgrounds, such as greek, japanese and mexican food.
